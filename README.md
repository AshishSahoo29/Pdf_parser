This project is designed to effectively parse multi-line PDF files, focusing on extracting multiple-choice questions and their options with high accuracy. It handles complex PDF structures, recognizing questions and options even when they span multiple lines or have unusual formatting. The system ensures that all questions and their corresponding options are correctly interpreted and displayed on the frontend, allowing users to easily manage, edit, and review the content.
